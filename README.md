# HW4: Wind Power Potential in Iowa
## Student authors: Mia Forsline & Alexandra Yousefivand
### Due 2021-12-03

## Motivation and project goal
The goal of this project is to evaluate the maximum potential annual wind energy production available to the state of Iowa; i.e., the number of megawatt hours (MWh) that would be generated by placing as many 3.45 MW wind turbines as possible on all appropriate sites. This analysis is useful to establish cost and benefit boundaries for renewable energy projects in Iowa to mitigate the climate crisis.

## Intended purpose and important concepts
As this project is intended for educational purposes, the student authors practiced the following:
- connecting to a PostGIS database
- integrating SQL queries into a jupyter-notebook
- merging multiple SQL subqueries
- implementing spatial overlay
- calculating energy production
- calling assigned variables in printed text to report reproducible results

## Future research
Future research aims to inform policy regarding renewable wind energy in the United States and abroad. Additionally, further research could explore different scenarios, other than the two housing scenarios included in this study.

## Installation
The following packages were utilized during this analysis:
- sqlalchemy
- psycopg2
- geopandas
- math

## Data
Due to large file sizes, data for this analysis is NOT hosted in the repository. Data can be accessed from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84) and uses the following file structure.
